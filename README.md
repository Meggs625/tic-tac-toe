## Technologies Used

## Goals
  For this project, I started with three goals:
    1. To gain a better understanding of when/how to use localStorage.
    2. How to correctly differentiate between the DOM and the Data Model
    3. Use event bubbling when appropriate
## Features
  This page will allow the user to:
    * Begin a new personalized game of Tic-Tac-Toe by entering the players' displayNames.
    * Accurately track the turns and wins as game play progresses.
    * Does not allow for player icons to override one that has already been placed.
    * Does not allow for players to continue to click open sections after winner has been declared.
    * Maintain the turn and win upon page reload.
    * Clear previous history to allow for a new players to start a new game.
